🚀 AI Collaboration Template Message for Checkpoints

Here’s a reusable template that you can copy and paste when starting a new AI session. It ensures all AI assistants follow the structured checkpoint system without you needing to rewrite it each time.

📌 Template for First-Time AI Sessions

Before we begin, please follow a structured checkpoint system to track progress across AI conversations.

---

### **📝 Checkpoint System Overview**
I am using a **file-based checkpoint system** to track long-term projects. You must follow this format so that I can keep multiple AI assistants in sync.

#### **🚀 What You Need to Do:**
✅ Every **50-100 messages**, generate a **checkpoint** summarizing progress.  
✅ When starting a new chat, **always ask:**  
📌 _"Do you have a previous checkpoint file (e.g., `checkpoint_2000_YYYY-MM-DD.json` or `.md`)? If so, please upload it, and I'll restore the context."_  
✅ If I upload a **checkpoint file**, process it and summarize key details.  

---

### **📂 Checkpoint Format**
Each checkpoint should be saved as **JSON (`.json`) or Markdown (`.md`)** with the following structure:

**📌 File Naming Format:**  
`checkpoint_[number]_[YYYY-MM-DD].json`  
✅ **Example:**  
- `checkpoint_2000_2025-02-14.json`  
- `checkpoint_1500_2025-01-20.md`

### **📝 Example Checkpoint (Markdown Format)**

📝 Checkpoint #2000 – AI Event Recommender Progress 📅 Date: February 14, 2025 🔢 Total Messages Since Last Checkpoint: 75

🧩 Recent Work Completed: ✅ Built content-based filtering using TF-IDF. ✅ Implemented collaborative filtering with SVD. ✅ Developed API structure for real-time recommendations.

⏳ Current Work in Progress:

Testing API deployment with FastAPI.

Evaluating cloud storage options (Google Drive vs AWS).


🔜 Next Steps:

1. Optimize API performance.


2. Implement real-time tracking for recommendations.


3. Choose cloud storage for long-term event storage.



📌 Notes: If I need to reset this chat, please refer to this checkpoint to continue seamlessly.

### **🔄 Restoring Context in a New Chat**
1️⃣ If I **upload a previous checkpoint file**, immediately process it and summarize key details.  
2️⃣ If I **don’t provide a checkpoint**, ask:  
   📌 _"Would you like to provide a previous checkpoint file to continue from the last known progress?"_  
3️⃣ If multiple checkpoint files exist, summarize the **latest one** unless I request more history.  

📌 **Question for the AI:**  
_"Would you like me to upload the latest checkpoint now?"_

---

✅ Copy and paste this whenever starting a new AI session to ensure they follow the checkpoint system.

📌 Template for Continuing a Project

If an AI already understands the system, you don’t need to send the full prompt—just provide the latest checkpoint.

Here’s the latest checkpoint file for this project: `checkpoint_2000_2025-02-14.json`.  
Please process it and summarize the last known progress before we continue.

🚀 How This Helps You

✅ Consistent AI responses across different sessions.
✅ No need to repeat long explanations—AI assistants just read the checkpoint file.
✅ You can switch between AI instances seamlessly without losing progress.

Would you like me to format this as a downloadable .txt file so you can save it for future use? 🚀
