### 🧩 **Recent Work Completed**

   - Updated styles to feature a gradient background, hero text, and navigation links.

3. **Landing Page Structure:**  
   - Separated a `LandingPage` component (optional) to show hero + events.  
   - Integrated the new header design for a cohesive landing page look.

4. **TypeScript Fixes & Type Safety:**  
   - Ensured `Event` interface was fully satisfied by sample data.  
   - Resolved mismatches in `id` and other optional fields (`subcategory`, `end_date`, `source`).
