## 📝 Checkpoint #2104 – Las Vegas AI Deployment & Connectivity
**📅 Date:** February 14, 2025  
**🔢 Total Messages Since Last Checkpoint:** (updates as per conversation count)

### 🧩 Recent Work Completed
- **Backend Docker Setup:**
  - Moved the Dockerfile into the `backend` folder.
  - Updated the Dockerfile to copy the current directory (`COPY . /app/`) and install dependencies via `requirements.txt`.
  - Resolved container name conflicts by removing existing containers.
  - Updated Docker Compose to use host port **5001** (backend accessible at `http://localhost:5001`).

- **Dependency Management:**
  - Ensured that all required packages (including `tenacity`) are in `requirements.txt`.
  - Rebuilt the Docker image so that the Flask app now runs without import errors.

- **Backend Functionality:**
  - Verified that the Flask backend runs correctly with `flask run --port=5001`.
  - Tested endpoints manually (e.g., `/api/events` returns HTTP 200).

- **Frontend Integration:**
  - Updated frontend API URLs/proxy configuration in `vite.config.js` and `eventService.ts` to point to `http://localhost:5001`.
  - Confirmed that the frontend is now successfully communicating with the backend.

### ⏳ Current Work in Progress
- Monitoring ongoing data ingestion and event processing.
- Refining the Docker Compose configuration if needed for production deployments.
- Further improvements to error handling and logging.

### 🔜 Next Steps
1. **Test Full System Functionality:**  
   - Continue testing API endpoints and frontend data rendering.
   - Validate that new events are ingested and updated as expected.

2. **Setup Scheduled Ingestion:**  
   - Once the system is stable, configure cron jobs or containerized scheduled tasks to run the data ingestion script periodically.

3. **Documentation & Enhancements:**  
   - Update additional documentation based on these deployment changes.
   - Prepare for future enhancements (e.g., advanced filtering, recommendation improvements).
