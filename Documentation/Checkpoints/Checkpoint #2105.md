📝 Checkpoint #1000 – AI Event Recommender & Backend Debugging

📅 Date: February 14, 2025
🔢 Total Messages Since Last Checkpoint: 100+

🧩 Recent Work Completed:

✅ Flask backend is set up with PostgreSQL using flask_sqlalchemy and flask_migrate.
✅ Implemented models for Event, User, UserInteraction, and Recommendation.
✅ Developed event retrieval API (/api/events), including filters for category, price range, and timeframe.
✅ Implemented caching with @lru_cache for optimized recommendations.
✅ Successfully connected to the PostgreSQL database via psql.

⏳ Current Work in Progress:

🚧 Issue: Flask API is not responding to requests (curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 5000).
🚧 Potential Causes:
	•	Flask might not be running or is running on a different port (5001 instead of 5000).
	•	Port conflict (another process using 5000).
	•	Firewall or network issue blocking requests.

Debugging Steps:

1️⃣ Check if Flask is running:

lsof -i :5000
lsof -i :5001

2️⃣ Restart Flask API explicitly on port 5001:

FLASK_APP=app.py flask run --port=5001

3️⃣ Test API response:

curl http://localhost:5001/api/events

4️⃣ Check PostgreSQL event data:

psql -U myuser -d las_vegas_db -h localhost -p 5432 -c "SELECT id, name, start_date FROM events ORDER BY start_date DESC LIMIT 10;"

	•	Ensure new events exist and are being retrieved.

🔜 Next Steps:

1️⃣ Fix Flask API connectivity issue.
2️⃣ Verify new events are appearing in the frontend.
3️⃣ Ensure API returns expected results (/api/events).
4️⃣ Test /api/recommendations to verify the recommendation engine is working.

📌 Notes:
	•	If Flask is running but unresponsive, check logs for errors.
	•	If necessary, restart PostgreSQL (sudo service postgresql restart).
