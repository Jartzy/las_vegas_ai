Las Vegas AI - System Status & Documentation

Project Overview

Las Vegas AI is a Flask-based system that includes authentication, logging, AI-powered recommendations, and a React-based frontend. The project aims to provide AI-driven recommendations for Las Vegas attractions while ensuring secure user authentication and interaction tracking.

Key Features:
	â€¢	âœ… Secure Authentication: Login system with Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using OTP.
	â€¢	âœ… AI-Powered Recommendations: Machine learning-based personalized suggestions.
	â€¢	âœ… User Feedback System: Users can like/dislike recommendations to refine AI predictions.
	â€¢	âœ… Chatbot Assistant: AI chatbot for travel-related questions and recommendations.
	â€¢	âœ… Logging & Monitoring: Tracks user actions, API calls, and errors.
	â€¢	âœ… Containerized Deployment: Uses Docker & Nginx for easy scalability.

export FLASK_APP=backend/app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development


	â€¢	Run the Flask server:

flask run


	3.	Frontend Setup:
	â€¢	Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd frontend


	â€¢	Install dependencies:

npm install

npm start



Docker Deployment
	â€¢	Build the Containers:

docker-compose build


	â€¢	Run the Containers:

docker-compose up


	â€¢	Access the Application:
	â€¢	The app should be available via the configured Nginx proxy.

Production Considerations
	â€¢	Use a production-ready WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn) for the Flask backend.
	â€¢	Secure environment variables (e.g., with Docker secrets or a dedicated vault solution).
	â€¢	Set up robust logging and monitoring (using tools such as Sentry or Prometheus).

Testing & Quality Assurance
	â€¢	Unit Testing:
	â€¢	Use pytest for backend unit tests.
	â€¢	Integration Testing:
	â€¢	Test API endpoints with tools like Postman or automated integration tests.
	â€¢	Frontend Testing:
	â€¢	Utilize Jest and React Testing Library for component and integration tests.
	â€¢	CI/CD:
	â€¢	Implement pipelines using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or similar tools to automate testing and deployment.

Developer Guidelines
	â€¢	Coding Standards:
	â€¢	Follow PEP8 for Python code.
	â€¢	Adhere to the Airbnb JavaScript/React style guide.
	â€¢	Commit Message Conventions:
	â€¢	Use Conventional Commits (e.g., feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, test:).
	â€¢	Pull Request Workflow:
	â€¢	Submit feature branches and include relevant tests/documentation updates.
	â€¢	Issue Tracking:
	â€¢	Use GitHub Issues to manage bugs, feature requests, and improvements.

Future Roadmap
	â€¢	Mobile Application:
	â€¢	Develop a mobile app using React Native for on-the-go access.
	â€¢	Enhanced AI Capabilities:
	â€¢	Integrate more advanced machine learning models and real-time recommendation updates.
	â€¢	Social Integration:
	â€¢	Implement social media logins and sharing functionalities.
	â€¢	Multilingual Support:
	â€¢	Localize the UI to support multiple languages.
	â€¢	Real-time Communication:

Troubleshooting & FAQs
	â€¢	Database Connection Issues:
	â€¢	Verify that your environment variables for the database connection are correctly set.
	â€¢	2FA/OTP Problems:
	â€¢	Ensure that your OTP generator (e.g., Google Authenticator) is synchronized with the serverâ€™s time and that the QR code is scanned correctly.
	â€¢	Deployment Hiccups:
